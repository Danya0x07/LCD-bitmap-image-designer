st7565-designer is a HTML5 web application for designing bitmaps and fonts for the st7565 graphical lcd. 
Encoded bitmaps and fonts work well with Adafruit's ST7565 arduino library. This web application was written
for my own use and was designed to run locally on my own computer. I tested it with recent releases of
Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. I did not test it in IE, nor do I intend to do so.

Usage:

Draw a line between the last pixel and the current pixel by holding down the shift key.
Undo with ctrl-z or command-z. No redo yet.
Save and restore bitmaps/fonts from local storage
Export/Import all items to/from a JSON file

Known issues:

- Chrome does not allow file access from local files by default, which is neceassary for this app to work properly. 
If run locally (i.e. not through a hostor local server), start chrome with the '--allow-file-access-from-files' flag 
or run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' in the directory you've saved the repo in

- Current version of Safari (5.1.7 at time of testing in May 2012) doesn't support the FileReader object. Attempting to 
load saved bitmaps/fonts from a json file won't work as a result. Webkit nightlies do support FileReader, suggesting 
Safari may well do so as well in a future release. Webkit nightlies available from http://nightly.webkit.org/

- No anomalies noted in Firefox
