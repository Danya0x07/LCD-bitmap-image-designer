> This program can be used also for LCD-s with other dismensions, not only 128x64. For example, to make it 
work with PCD8544 84x48 LCD you need to edit files scripts/Dither.js and ./st7565.html replacing 128 and 64 wherever they would be met to 84 and 48 accordingly. And for other dismensions actions are the same.
>> I don't know JS and HTML, I just needed this tool to convert some image for Nokia 5110 LCD, so for me it is easier to "hack" it a little bit
than to add a feature, which allows user to select target dismensions.

#ST7565 Graphical LCD Designer#

st7565-designer is a HTML5 web application for designing bitmaps and fonts for the st7565 graphical lcd. 
Encoded bitmaps and fonts work well with Adafruit's ST7565 arduino library. This web application was written
for my own use and was designed to run locally on my own computer. I tested it with recent releases of
Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. I did not test it in IE, nor do I intend to do so.

##Usage:

- Draw a line between the last pixel and the current pixel by holding down the shift key.
- Undo with ctrl-z or command-z. No redo yet.
- Save and restore bitmaps/fonts from local storage
- Export/Import all saved items to/from a JSON file
- Drag and drop an image on the canvas (with canvas dimensions set to 128x64) to write a dithered approximation of the image to the display
- Current quantization/dithering techniques available: Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, and Sierra Lite (Sierra-2-4A), and Threshold

##Known issues:

- Chrome does not allow file access from local files by default, which is neceassary for this app to work properly. 
If run locally (i.e. not through a host or local server), start chrome with the '--allow-file-access-from-files' flag 
or run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' in the directory you've saved the repo in (not necessary w/ node-webkit implementation)

- Current version of Safari (5.1.7 at time of testing in May 2012) doesn't support the FileReader object. Attempting to 
load saved bitmaps/fonts from a json file won't work as a result. Webkit nightlies do support FileReader, suggesting 
Safari may well do so as well in a future release. Webkit nightlies available from http://nightly.webkit.org/

- No anomalies noted in Firefox

- Some dithering methods result in stray pixels. Currently investigating why. 

##Node-webkit:

- Behaves more like a true "native" application with file save dialogs and access to the system clipboard. 

##Revision History:
**3/28/13**- Added node-webkit implementation.  
 
**12/15/12**- Threshold quantization for dropped images added to dithering routines.  
 
**11/27/12**- Support for one-bit image dithering added. Drop an image onto the display canvas and behold the wonders!  

**6/28/12**- Initial commit.
