A modified version of the original application for use with node-webkit. Adds the following:

- Filesystem access and "Save As" dialog for JSON file export
- Copy display encoding to system clipboard for easy pasting in another application

All that's needed to get up and running is the nw-archive.nw file, although all the modified source is included here for reference or to use as a starting point for additional functionality
